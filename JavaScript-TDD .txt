TDD = Test Drive Development

TDD is an approach to writing software where your write tests before you write
application code.

Basic Step - The TDD Mantra "Red, Green, Refactor":
  Red - write a test and make sure it fails.
  Green - write the simplest, easiest possible code to make it pass
  Refactor - optimise and/or simplify application code, make sure it still passes
  all tests.
  
Main benefit of TDD is that it will instill in you to write tests and write simpler
code.

There is a step before before Red. The thinking step. Conceptualize how the code will
work. This is Development not Design.

In these notes I'll be using Mocha and Chai

  $ cd /the/file/you/are/working/on
  $ npm install mocha -g
  $ npm install chai
  
You'll create two files. For example: photo-fetcher.js, and photo-fetcher-spec.js. 
The spec file is the file you will do your tests on.

In the spec file begin thinking of the simplest test code that will move your code
forward.
